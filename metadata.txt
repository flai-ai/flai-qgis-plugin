about=
    This QGIS plugin offers access to <b>Open Lidar Data Hub</b>, an expanding public repository of high-resolution lidar datasets available for exploration and download directly within QGIS.

    In addition, it integrates with the <b>Flai Processing Engine</b>, enabling you to run Flai’s pretrained AI classifiers on your own hardware via the Flai CLI. These classifiers support automatic object recognition across a wide range of aerial, mobile, and forestry use cases — including detection of <b>ground, buildings, power line wires, towers, bridges, tree trunks, fallen trees</b>, and more.
